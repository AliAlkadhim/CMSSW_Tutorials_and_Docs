Science is built on the concepts of reproducibility and replicability: the way we confirm the validity of new discoveries is by repeating the research that produced them. Inadequate recordkeeping for the CMS experiment is one of the main reasons that methods, codes, data, protocols, etc. are non-reproducible or non-replicable. It also take a very significant part of CMS analysists' time and energy, which could have been spent at making new discoveries as opposed to trying to replicate discoveries that have already been made.

This repository is my attempt to document and give tutorials on CMSSW and typlical analyses that are done in the experiment, based on my notes. It will help me by making things easy to look up and use, and I hope it helps others (especially new analysts.)
